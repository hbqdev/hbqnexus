# Welcome to The Nexus 🌌

Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! This is where I share my thoughts, projects, and explorations with the world. I have many self-hosted services that I use daily, so this hub is where you can access them all in one place.

## What to Expect

This Blog will be a convergence of:
- 🛠️ Updates about my self-hosted services
- 📚 Experiments and tutorials
- 🤔 My nobody-asked thoughts on anything and everything.


# Join the Expedition

Whether you're here for the technical content, curious about self-hosting, or randomly found this blog, I'm glad you've docked at this station. Feel free to explore the services I host and check back regularly for new discoveries.

To the Moon! 🚀
